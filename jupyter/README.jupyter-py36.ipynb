    "The Customer Segmentation accelerator includes a structured glossary of more than 100 business terms and a set of sample data science assets. The glossary provides the information architecture that you need to segment customers based on demographics and commonalities in client behaviour. Your data scientists can use the sample notebooks, predictive models, and dashboards to accelerate data preparation, machine learning modeling and data reporting. Since there aren't any predefinied segments well need to discover those segments within the underlying data structure. Once that structure is found the clients will be assigned to their respective clusters. The segmentation basically helps you to understand how segments differ from one another. "
